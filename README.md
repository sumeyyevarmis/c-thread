# What is thread?
A thread is the way executive in a process. A process can have so many threads. these structures are called multithreading.
Thread have own program counter, a stack scope and a register set. Thread is not program; a thread can not run by itself. instead, the thread can run inside a program.

We will implement our examples using the Linux/Unix operating system.
